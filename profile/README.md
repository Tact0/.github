### + About Tact0
Tact0 is a technology company building deterministic AI infrastructure that governs how large language models behave in production environments.

Instead of relying on prompt engineering or opaque model behavior, Tact0 introduces a rule-based runtime layer that evaluates state, selects behavior modes, and validates outputs before they reach users.

The result is AI systems that are predictable, auditable, and safe to operate at scale.
